# Full-Stack Rails and React Application

## Project Overview
In this project, I am developing a full-stack application using Ruby on Rails and React, which provides a robust platform for managing coding challenges. The application features a rich user interface for creating, managing, and participating in various coding challenges.

## Key Features

- **Authentication System**: Utilizes JWT tokens to manage user sessions securely.
- **API Development**: Custom APIs built with Rails to handle all backend operations including data management and authentication processes.
- **Interactive Front-End**: Developed using React, integrated with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Rich Text Editing**: Supports detailed challenge descriptions with rich text capabilities including headings, links, and formatted text.
- **Dynamic Date Selection**: Implements a date picker for setting challenge timelines.

## Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails**: For creating robust APIs and handling backend logic including authentication.
- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive front-end.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JWT**: For secure authentication.
- **Git**: For version control and code management.

## Development Highlights

- Designed and implemented a full-stack solution that integrates Rails with React, providing a seamless user experience.
- Focused on building secure and scalable APIs to support the functionality of coding challenges.
- Prioritized UX/UI in the frontend development to ensure ease of use and accessibility.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Overcame challenges in integrating Rails 7 with React, navigating through common debates around this tech stack combination.
- Enhanced skills in full-stack development, deepening understanding of both frontend and backend interactions.

## Future Enhancements

- Plans to refine UI/UX elements based on user feedback.
- Continuous integration of additional features to support more interactive and engaging challenge participation.
